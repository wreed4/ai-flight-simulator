Hey! ðŸ‘‹ Human here!  This is the only human-generated content in this entire repo. Everything else is AI-generated, mostly with Zed AI using Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7.


# AI-Generated Flight Simulator

This project is a fully interactive 3D flight simulator built with JavaScript, THREE.js, and WebGL, entirely generated through AI.

## Features

- Realistic flight controls (W/S, A/D, arrow keys)
- Immersive 3D environment with trees, mountains, and terrain
- Aircraft physics simulation
- Crash detection with explosion effects
- Responsive camera that follows the aircraft
- Heads-up display showing flight information

## Running the Project

### Using Docker

The easiest way to run the flight simulator is using Docker:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t flight-simulator .

# Run the container, exposing port 5000 to the host
docker run -p 5000:5000 flight-simulator
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to start flying!


## Controls

- **W/S** or **Up/Down arrows**: Pitch control (nose up/down)
- **A/D**: Roll and turn (bank left/right)
- **Left/Right arrows**: Yaw control
- **Shift**: Increase throttle
- **Ctrl**: Decrease throttle
- **Space**: Pause game

## AI Generation

This entire project, including the code, documentation, and assets, was generated through collaborative interaction with AI. No manual coding was required beyond running the suggested commands.
